# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** February 23, 2026

These terms govern your use of the Tabi time-tracking platform ("Service"), a personal project operated by the Tabi developer ("we", "us", "our"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these terms.

## 1. Account Registration

You must provide accurate information when creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account. You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service.

## 2. Service Description

Tabi provides time tracking, screenshot monitoring, activity tracking, idle detection, project management, reporting, and invoicing tools for teams. The desktop application enables optional screenshot capture and activity monitoring when configured by an organization administrator.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful purpose.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other users' data.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract source code from the Service beyond what is permitted by the AGPL-3.0 license.
- Use the Service to monitor individuals without their knowledge and consent as required by applicable law.
- Upload malicious content or use the Service to distribute malware.
- Resell access to the Service without authorization.

## 4. Screenshot & Activity Monitoring

### Organization responsibilities
Organizations that enable screenshot and activity monitoring are solely responsible for:

- Obtaining informed consent from their team members before enabling monitoring.
- Informing team members about what data is captured, how it is used, and who can access it.
- Complying with all applicable privacy, employment, and labor laws in their jurisdiction.
- Configuring appropriate screenshot intervals and retention policies.

### Transparency
- The Tabi desktop application shows a visible tray icon whenever time tracking is active.
- A clear status indicator is displayed when screenshot capture is enabled.
- Team members can stop tracking at any time, which immediately stops all data collection including screenshots.

### What is captured
- Full-screen screenshots at the interval configured by the organization.
- Keyboard and mouse activity levels as percentages (no keystrokes or mouse coordinates are recorded).
- Idle time periods detected locally on the user's device.

Tabi is not responsible for how organizations use the monitoring data. Organizations assume all liability for compliance with local monitoring and privacy laws.

## 5. Data Ownership

- **Your data:** you retain full ownership of all time entries, screenshots, project data, and other content you create in the Service. You may export your data at any time.
- **Our license:** you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to store, process, and display your data solely for the purpose of providing the Service. This license terminates when your data is deleted.

## 6. Pricing & Payment

The Service offers two monthly subscription plans:

- **Standard:** $3 per seat per month
- **Pro:** $5 per seat per month

Plans are billed monthly based on the number of active seats in your organization. We may change pricing with at least 30 days' notice to existing subscribers. Price changes do not affect the current billing period. You may cancel at any time; access continues until the end of your current billing period. Refunds are not provided for partial billing periods.

## 7. Free Trial & Free Tier

We may offer a free trial or free tier at our discretion. Free tiers may have feature or usage limitations. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue free offerings with 14 days' notice.

## 8. Service Availability

We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We are not liable for downtime caused by maintenance (which we will attempt to schedule during off-peak hours), infrastructure failures, or circumstances beyond our control.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- Tabi's total liability for any claims arising from use of the Service is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including loss of profits, data, or business opportunities.
- We are not liable for any actions taken by organization administrators using monitoring features, including misuse of screenshots or activity data.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these terms, or your organization's use of monitoring features in violation of applicable law.

## 11. Termination

- **By you:** you may delete your account at any time through the application settings.
- **By us:** we may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, with notice where practicable.
- **Effect of termination:** upon termination, your data will be retained for 30 days to allow export, then permanently deleted.

## 12. Open Source

Tabi is built on open-source software licensed under AGPL-3.0. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MohamedyamanAI/tabi). These terms govern your use of the hosted Service only. Use of the source code is governed by the AGPL-3.0 license.

## 13. Dispute Resolution

Before initiating any formal proceedings, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.

## 14. Severability

If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## 15. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. We will notify registered users of material changes via email at least 14 days before they take effect. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 16. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts located in Delaware.
